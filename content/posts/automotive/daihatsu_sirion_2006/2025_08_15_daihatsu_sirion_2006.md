summary = "Since i have been working in the automotive industry for almost 2 years now, i think it's kind of time to get into cars. My very first project will be a FULL checkup of a Daihatsu Sirion 2006. From the internals to the externals and there will be soooooo much to learn. Lets dive in."

## Preliminary knowledge

In this chapter i'll be talking about my knowledge state and what i did to ramp up.

### My current skill set

The skill set goes as far:
- Drivers license achieved 2 years ago, but haven't driven since (just picked up driving again)
- Knowledge about steering system due to my job
- Okay physics
- Shit ton of motivation for learning/ understanding new things and researching.
  
Hardest part will be to identify not obvious deviations that happen during driving, since i have almost no expertise in feeling out the car, hear things etc.


## Theoretical ramp-up

Multiple videos were digested in a couple of days (see [#References](#references)) to get a basic understanding of the internal workings of the car. I think i get the general idea now.

### Key technical parameters of a car

TODO write about the parameters of the car which can be used to determine the "goodness".

### Car specific stuff

The only thing i know about the car is that its a Daihatsu Sirion 2006. When i first tried to google these exact phrase couldn't really find the proper model because of the lot of results.

I tried to search for something like a database that has information on car models so somehow i could identify the car and its internal parts.

Found a site called [ultimateSPECS](https://www.ultimatespecs.com/) which was recommended on multiple forums. It even seemed alright, had a category for Daihatsu and also the specific model, however i could not match the tested car to any of the ones on the site. There where even 2 models:

In the normal variant no 2006 model listed, however in the Sirion II there is one from the year 2006.

It looks good however, i feel like a more accurate and authentic source is needed. After more thinking...

### Gathering more stuff

More information was needed to accurately identify the parts of the car. I knew about VIN ( Vehicle Identification Number) which is a unique id for every car. Based on this, things could be looked up. Lot of shitty ass paid databases, i checked some of them with the cars VIN, however didn't really find a hit.

One other thing you can do in my country (and probably in others) to lookup a cars detailed information based on the name plate. So I did that.

Got the engine number, thats awesome, also the actual model M3. Remember the engine displacement from the [ultimateSPECS](https://www.ultimatespecs.com/) site? The engine displacement differs so that information is considered invalid for us. Good thinking we kept looking.


## Testing of the car

The car will be inspected from 3 main perspective, trying to identify as many deviation as possible:
- Test drive
- Engine bay
- Interior and exterior

Unfortunately because of the lack of tools i cannot view the car from the bottom.

### Preparation

We identified the model of the car and
